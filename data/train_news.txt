Struggling with a lack of Self-Confidence is huge problem. It's also incredibly
common.
95% of the clients I have worked with over the past 25 years have had issues with
Self-Confidence in specific areas of their life.
Although feeling under-confident is not intentional, many people struggle with it
their entire lives.
No one sets out to get stuck in a job they don't like because they don’t have the
Self-Confidence to change jobs or start their own business.
No one sets out to get stuck in a disempowering relationship or social circle,
surrounded by people who don't really love and care about them.
No one sets out to be indecisive and procrastinate.
No one sets out to be nervous and anxious in social situations.
No one set out to struggle financially.
No one sets out to be unhealthy, overweight and out of shape.
But even though you may not have intentionally set out to have these things in your
life, it's a safe bet that some or all of them affect your life in one way or another.
Unfortunately these kinds of problems usually don't solve themselves. More often
than not, they actually get worse.
A mediocre career doesn't suddenly get better. It acts like a slow sinking ship over a
period of years.
A bad financial situation (too much debt, not earning enough money, not
experiencing financial flow) doesn't magically fix itself.
A disempowering social circle or relationship situation doesn't suddenly become
uplifting and supportive. Usually it drags you down further with each passing year.
An inability to respond confidently in social situations, meet new people, or ask for
a date doesn’t suddenly get better over time.
1A battle with your weight or lack of exercise won’t change by buying the next
exercise gadget or reading another diet book.
Without the Self-Confidence to change these situations we often feel stuck. Rather
than making the changes, we turn to multiple forms of distraction -- web surfing,
TV, video games, compulsive drinking, smoking, eating, drugs, etc. Deep down, the
lack of Self-Confidence and dissatisfaction builds because we know our lives have
gotten way off track.
But how do we fix it? – Let’s take a look.
You can only go for so many years dealing with boring jobs, inadequate finances,
unsupportive relationships, and destructive health habits. Eventually those things
will begin to erode your Self-Confidence.
Seriously now... isn't it much better to admit that we need to handle our Self-
Confidence issues as opposed to denying we have them?
Lots of people succumb to denial. They act like they're growing, evolving and
successful, when in reality nothing is significantly changing for them.
So how can you determine if you can use some help in building your Self-
Confidence?
There is a simple formula that will measure your current Level of Self-Confidence
with 100% accuracy.
The first step is to look at your life and see if there is any evidence that you're
significantly better off now vs. 90 days ago.
What amazing results have you accomplished during that time?
The second step is to give each result a number from 1-10. 1 would be nothing has
changed, and 10 would be significant progress.
If you're really confident in EVERY AREA OF YOUR LIFE and making progress, you
should be able to name a number of significant breakthroughs that occurred during
the last 90 days, and they should be objective and observable.
It can be pretty tough to look at ourselves objectively, especially when we don’t like
what we see. No one wants to predict that a year from now, they’ll have lost their
home due to foreclosure, gained 20 pounds of fat, and endured a string of bad
relationships.
Try this: Make some predictions about where you’ll be in a year, but base your
predictions only on hard factual evidence from the past 90 days of your life. Assume
those same patterns will continue for another 12 months. Where will they lead if
you largely repeated the patterns of the past 90 days for a full 12 months?
Telling Yourself The Truth
A huge part of telling yourself the truth is being able to make honest, objective
predictions about where you’re headed.
In order to make accurate predictions, you cannot use your goals or intentions as an
accurate indicator of where you will be in the future.
Imagine that you’re in a court of law that’s trying to make a ruling based on the
facts of the case. Your goals and intentions for the future are inadmissible as
evidence because they are not hard facts. They’re merely opinions or speculation
about what may be. Based on the hard facts – your recent past - what do you think
that ruling would be?
In order to make accurate predictions of where you’re headed, you must look to
your recent past and only your recent past.
This may be something you didn’t want to hear, but I am just being honest with you.
When you study and learn from your past, you’ll notice certain patterns that come
up repeatedly that keep you stuck. All of these patterns are rooted in your lack of
Self-Confidence to follow through and make the changes.
One of those patterns is the “start-stop” approach.
This is when someone gets a strong desire to change. They feel a surge of positive
emotion and decide that finally things will be different. They usually believe it too.
They set some new goals and intentions and start taking some actions, but because
of a lack of Self-Confidence their actions are inconsistent. Most of their actions are
one-offs, meaning that they never get integrated as permanent habits. For example
they get highly motivated to change - usually after reading a book or taking a
personal development program - then they will get started, but that’s usually as far
as it goes.
Eventually the excitement over the new direction and information fizzles, and the
person stops changing and gets sucked back into their old under-confident patterns
from the past. No real lasting change occurs.
Now don’t get me wrong. Goals and intentions are powerful. Having clarity about
what you’re going to do next is important. But deciding what you want is only the
first step. And if that’s all you do, then I predict you will have some occasional
success, but for the most part your life will be a repeated pattern of “start-stop”
mediocrity. I’ve seen that pattern play out enough times across enough people’s
lives that I consider such results fairly predictable.
